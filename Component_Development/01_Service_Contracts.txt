1. Service Contracts (https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/extension-dev-guide/service-contracts/design-patterns.html)
Service contract must define Data Interfaces and Service Interfaces. Also Search Result Interface should be defined to use it in repository method getList();
Service Interfaces:
	- Repository Interfaces
	- Management Interfaces
	- Metadata Interfaces
Repository Interfaces provide access to data entities. They must define following methods:
	- save (data entity interface) - If an ID is not specified, creates a record. If an ID is specified, updates the record for the specified ID.
	- get(id) - Performs a database lookup by ID.Returns a data entity interface, such as CustomerInterface or AddressInterface.
	- getList(SearchCriteria) - Performs a search for all data entities that match specified search criteria. Returns a search results interface that gives access to the set of matches.
	- delete(data entity interface) - Deletes a specified entity. The entity contains the key (ID).
	- deleteById(id) - Deletes a specified entity by key (ID).
Manegement Interfaces provide functions which are not related with repositories, for example:
	- createAccount()
	- changePassword()
	- activate()
	- validate(), etc.
